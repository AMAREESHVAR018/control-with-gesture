🎮🤖 Hand Gesture Controlled Game System

A powerful real-time AI-driven hand gesture recognition and game control system built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI, and custom gesture-classification algorithms.
This project enables users to control PC games using hand gestures, removing the need for a keyboard or controller.

🚀 Project Overview

This system uses a webcam to track your hand, detect landmarks, classify gestures, and convert them into game actions.
It supports basic, intermediate, and advanced gestures with high accuracy.

✨ Features

✔ Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe

✔ Advanced gesture classifier (swipe, pinch, grab, peace, rock, OK)

✔ Game action mapping (accelerate, brake, jump, duck, fire…)

✔ Dynamic HUD display for live gesture output

✔ Gesture-based racing game demo

✔ Architecture & gesture mapping charts

✔ Modular code structure for easy updates

🧠 Core Modules
🔹 1. Advanced Gesture Recognition

Implements complex gestures like Swipe Left/Right/Up/Down, Rock On, Spiderman, Call Me, Grab, Pinch, etc.
Located in: advanced_gestures.py

🔹 2. Gesture → Keyboard Mapping Controller

Maps each gesture to a game action like Turn Left, Brake, Fire, etc.
Located in: gesture_game_controller.py
